# History of Behcet's Disease

## Earliest Characterizations of BD&#x20;

Behcet's Disease is thought to be first characterized by the famous Greek physician Hippocrates of Kos back in 500 BC in his third "Epidemion" book. Hippocrates describes a disease that he witnessed:&#x20;

> “But there were also other fevers, as it will be described. Many had their mouths affected with aphthous ulcerations. There were also many defluxions about the genital parts, and ulcerations, boils (phymata), externally and internally about the groins. Watery ophthalmies of a chronic character, with pains; fungous excrescences of the eyelids, externally and internally, called fici, which destroyed the sight of many persons…”.

Hippocrates never associated this collection of symptoms with a singular disease, but rather only documented the existence of such a patient.&#x20;

## The 1930s: Adamantiades and Behcet

Fast-forward to the year 1930 AD, nearly 2400 years after Hippocrates documented the above collection of symptoms, another Greek physician named Benediktos Adamantiades started documenting patients who presented with a combination of ocular symptoms, arthritis, and genital ulcers. Adamantiades published a case report in literature that read as follows:

> The case report was related to a 20 year old male, whose first clinical symptoms were edema and ulcerations of his left leg with a primary diagnosis of thrombophlebitis. In a two years follow-up, the patient developed recurrent iritis with hypopyon in both eyes, resulting in blindness and atrophy of the optic nerve, scrotal ulcers, oral aphthous ulcers, and sterile arthritis of both knees. The last three signs were recurrent and the bacterial cultures of the knees and eyes were negative.

Adamantiades went on to study the disease over the next thirty years, with his work culminating in the first diagnostic criteria for Behcet's being published in 1953. Many regard Adamantiades as the "co-discoverer" of Behcet's Disease, as evidenced by the number of older journals that call the disease "Adamantiades Disease" or "Adamantiades-Behcet's Disease".&#x20;

The disease is ultimately named after Hulusi Behcet, who is a Turkish doctor that first recognized and published about a "new" disease characterized by mouth ulcers, genital ulcers, and uveitis. Others have done a better job writing about how Dr. Behcet came to discover the disease, so an excerpt about him is below.&#x20;

> Hulusi Behçet was born on 20 February 1889 in Istanbul. Hulusi Behçet was raised by his grandmother after his mother’s death when he was young and he had a difficult childhood. He settled in Damascus because of his father’s work. He studied at a French school and learned French, Latin, and German. In 1906, he started Kuleli Military Medical School when he was only 16 years old and graduated in 1910. After his specialization training on skin and venereal diseases in Gulhane Military Hospital, he worked in Edirne Military hospital for 4 years. Afterwards, he went to Europe and worked in Budapest and Berlin for a short time and returned to his country. He worked as a freelance doctor for a while, and then he worked at Haskoy Venereal Diseases Hospital and Guraba Hospital after that in 1933; he became the head of the Department of Skin and Venereal Diseases of Istanbul University and continued this position until 1947.
>
> He is interested in many different areas of dermatology such as syphilis, leishmaniasis**,** dermatitis _Figus carcia_, parasitosis, and mycosis, but he is mostly known for his studies on Behçet’s disease, which is named after him. He presented his research in many national and international meetings and congresses and published 126 articles between 1921 and 1940.
>
> Studies on Behçet’s disease began with a patient he first saw in 1924.The patient had recurrent hypopyon uveitis accompanied by ulcerations in the mouth and scrotum, painful nodules on the legs, fever, and joint pain and was variously diagnosed in Istanbul and Vienna and was followed by Hulusi Behçet later on for many more years.
>
> In 1930, he conducted a study on a female patient with recurrent ocular symptoms and oral and genital lesions and in 1936 on a male patient with oral pemphigus-like wounds, acneiform lesions on the back, scrotal ulcer, night fever, abdominal pain, and ocular symptoms.
>
> As a result of his research on these three patients, Hulusi Behçet first suggested in 1937 that recurrent oral aphthous lesions, genital ulceration, and recurrent hypopyon uveitis were the symptoms of a single disease as a triple symptom complex. He wrote this view in 1937 in the journal _Dermatologische Wochenschrift_ and presented it to his colleagues at a congress in France in the same year. At the same congress, it was suggested that viruses may play a role in the etiology of this condition, especially those of dental origin.\
> In 1938, _Dermatologische Wohenschrift_ published his thoughts in more detail. In the following years, new case reports came from different countries. While ophthalmologists accepted this new disease, dermatologists believed it to be a symptom of another existing skin disease. However, as a result of the new articles published in different parts of the world, the disease was accepted to be a separate entity. At the international medical congress in Geneva, with the suggestion of Prof. Mischner from Zurich Medical Faculty, this newly diagnosed disease was called “Morbus Behçet”.

## Early Classification Systems

Although it is a relatively young disease, many different diagnostic/classification criteria have been developed.&#x20;
