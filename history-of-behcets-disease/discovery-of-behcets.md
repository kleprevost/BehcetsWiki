# Discovery of Behcet's

In 1956, the ophthalmologist Feigenbaum highlighted the first description of Behcet's syndrome by Hippocrates of Kos \[[2](javascript:;),[3](javascript:;)]. According to Feigenbaum, Hippocrates wrote in his third “Epidemion” book; case 7, “But there were also other fevers, as it will be described. Many had their mouths affected with aphthous ulcerations. There were also many defluxions about the genital parts, and ulcerations, boils (phymata), externally and internally about the groins. Watery ophthalmies of a chronic character, with pains; fungous excrescences of the eyelids, externally and internally, called fici, which destroyed the sight of many persons…”\[[2](javascript:;),[3](javascript:;)].

Zouboulis and Keitel, in their well-documented historical review, showed that the Greek ophthalmologist Benediktos Adamantiades (1875-1962) brought the ocular signs, genital ulcers and the arthritis in connection with a single disease \[[3](javascript:;)]. On 15th of November 1930, Adamantiades presented a case report entitled “A case of relapsing iritis with hypopyon” at the annual meeting of the Medical Association of Athens and this presentation was published in the Proceedings of the Medical Society of Athens \[[3](javascript:;),[4](javascript:;)]. The case report was related to a 20 year old male, whose first clinical symptoms were edema and ulcerations of his left leg with a primary diagnosis of thrombophlebitis. In a two years follow-up, the patient developed recurrent iritis with hypopyon in both eyes, resulting in blindness and atrophy of the optic nerve, scrotal ulcers, oral aphthous ulcers, and sterile arthritis of both knees. The last three signs were recurrent and the bacterial cultures of the knees and eyes were negative \[[3](javascript:;),[4](javascript:;)]. Adamantiades went on to publish this case report in the French journal Annales d'Oculistique in 1931 \[[5](javascript:;)]. In 1946, Adamantiades reported on two further patients and defined thrombophlebitis as a fourth sign of the disease \[[3](javascript:;)]. In 1953, he presented the first classification of the disease and proposed the first diagnostic criteria and in 1958, his last work regarding its neurologic complications \[[3](javascript:;)] was published.









Hulusi Behçet was born on 20 February 1889 in Istanbul. Hulusi Behçet was raised by his grandmother after his mother’s death when he was young and he had a difficult childhood. He settled in Damascus because of his father’s work. He studied at a French school and learned French, Latin, and German. In 1906, he started Kuleli Military Medical School when he was only 16 years old and graduated in 1910. After his specialization training on skin and venereal diseases in Gulhane Military Hospital, he worked in Edirne Military hospital for 4 years. Afterwards, he went to Europe and worked in Budapest and Berlin for a short time and returned to his country. He worked as a freelance doctor for a while, and then he worked at Haskoy Venereal Diseases Hospital and Guraba Hospital after that in 1933; he became the head of the Department of Skin and Venereal Diseases of Istanbul University and continued this position until 1947 \[[5](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B5), [6](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B6)].

He is interested in many different areas of dermatology such as syphilis, leishmaniasis**,** dermatitis _Figus carcia_, parasitosis, and mycosis, but he is mostly known for his studies on Behçet’s disease, which is named after him. He presented his research in many national and international meetings and congresses and published 126 articles between 1921 and 1940 \[[5](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B5), [6](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B6)].

Studies on Behçet’s disease began with a patient he first saw in 1924.The patient had recurrent hypopyon uveitis accompanied by ulcerations in the mouth and scrotum, painful nodules on the legs, fever, and joint pain and was variously diagnosed in Istanbul and Vienna and was followed by Hulusi Behçet later on for many more years \[[5](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B5), [6](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B6), [7](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B7)].

In 1930, he conducted a study on a female patient with recurrent ocular symptoms and oral and genital lesions and in 1936 on a male patient with oral pemphigus-like wounds, acneiform lesions on the back, scrotal ulcer, night fever, abdominal pain, and ocular symptoms \[[5](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B5), [6](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B6), [7](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B7)].

As a result of his research on these three patients, Hulusi Behçet first suggested in 1937 that recurrent oral aphthous lesions, genital ulceration, and recurrent hypopyon uveitis were the symptoms of a single disease as a triple symptom complex \[[4](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B4)]. He wrote this view in 1937 in the journal _Dermatologische Wochenschrift_ and presented it to his colleagues at a congress in France in the same year. At the same congress, it was suggested that viruses may play a role in the etiology of this condition, especially those of dental origin \[[5](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B5), [6](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B6), [8](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B8)] ([Figure 1](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#F1)).

\
In 1938, _Dermatologische Wohenschrift_ published his thoughts in more detail. In the following years, new case reports came from different countries. While ophthalmologists accepted this new disease, dermatologists believed it to be a symptom of another existing skin disease. However, as a result of the new articles published in different parts of the world, the disease was accepted to be a separate entity. At the international medical congress in Geneva, with the suggestion of Prof. Mischner from Zurich Medical Faculty, this newly diagnosed disease was called “Morbus Behçet” \[[5](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B5), [6](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B6)].

In 1930, Dr. Benedictos Adamantiades (1875–1962), a Greek ophthalmologist, reported a patient with recurrent hypopyonic irritation accompanied by mucocutaneous lesions and arthritis \[[9](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B9)]. In later years, he wrote new case reports, but he did not interpret this as a triple complex; focusing only on the eye, he suggested that hypopyonic iridocyclitis was a separate clinical disease by itself \[[10](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B10), [11](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B11), [12](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B12)]. Undoubtedly, although his colleagues from many parts of the world contributed to the acceptance of Behçet’s disease as a separate clinical entity, the first person to describe the triple triad and to present it to the world through his articles and presentations is our esteemed professor, doctor Hulusi Behçet.
