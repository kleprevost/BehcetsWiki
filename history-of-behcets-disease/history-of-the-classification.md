# History of the Classification

&#x20;The first one was created by Curth in 1946 \[[15](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B15)]. In 1969, Hewitt et al. presented the diagnostic criteria and revised and reformed them in 1971 \[[16](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B16), [17](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B17)]. Many new diagnostic criteria have been established in the light of the studies that have been carried out until today. The main ones are Mason and Barnes in 1969, Japan criteria in 1972, Hubault and Hamza in 1974, O’Duffy in 1974, Chen in 1980, Dilsen et al. in 1986, Japan revised criteria in 1988, International Study Group (ISG) in 1990, Iran in 1993, Classification Tree in 1993, Dilsen revised in 2000, Korea in 2003, the International Criteria for Behçet’s Disease (ICBD) in 2006, and the revised ICBD in 2014 \[[18](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B18), [19](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B19), [20](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B20), [21](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B21), [22](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B22), [23](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B23), [24](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B24), [25](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B25), [26](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B26), [27](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B27), [28](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B28), [29](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B29), [30](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B30), [31](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B31), [32](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B32)].

The Japan Research Committee for Behçet’s Disease created the Japanese criteria in 1972. There are four major symptoms according to these criteria: oral aphthosis, genital aphthosis, skin lesions, and ocular findings. In the presence of an ocular lesion, one different major finding is sufficient for the diagnosis. If there are no ocular findings, the presence of the other three major findings is essential for the diagnosis. It is called “complete form” if there are four major findings, and it is called “incomplete form” if there are fewer findings \[[19](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B19)]. Japan criteria were revised in 1988. Five minor findings were added to the major findings, and two minor findings were suggested to replace one missing major finding. These minor findings include arthritis/arthralgia, gastrointestinal manifestations, vascular thrombosis, neurological manifestations, and epididymitis \[[24](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B24)].

In the Fourth International Conference on Behçet’s Disease, which was held in London in 1985, it was planned to establish a diagnostic criterion with high sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, the International Behçet’s Disease Study Group was established \[[25](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B25), [33](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B33)]. In 7 countries (France, Iran, Japan, Tunisia, Turkey, the UK, and the USA) and in 12 separate institutions, 912 Behçet patients together with 308 control patients were included in a study and followed up. Twenty-eight patients without oral ulceration were excluded from the study \[[25](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B25)]. In the light of the data obtained, “International Behçet’s Disease Study Group Classification Criteria” was established and published in 1990. ISG classification criteria consist of five items. The first criterion is recurrent oral ulceration at least three times a year and is a sine qua non. The other four criteria consist of recurrent genital ulceration, eye lesions (anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis), skin lesions (erythema nodosum, pseudofolliculitis, or papulopustular lesions), and positive pathergy test. In addition to the major criterion oral aphthosis, the existence of two of the four findings is enough for the diagnosis of Behçet’s disease \[[25](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B25), [34](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B34)] ([Table 1](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#tab1)).

\
The sensitivity and specificity of ISG classification criteria were found to be 92 and 97%, respectively \[[25](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B25)]. Although it is one of the most widely used criteria to date, several concerns about its sensitivity have arisen. In fact, many studies have been performed that measure the performance of diagnostic/classification criteria for Behçet’s disease. Because of the high specificity of ISG, the risk of another disease being misdiagnosed and classified as BD is very low. However, many Behçet’s disease patients go undiagnosed due to its low sensitivity \[[35](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B35)]. Another controversial issue is that oral aphthosis is an indispensable finding in ISG, but it has been shown that oral aphthosis may not be in 1–10% of BD patients \[[36](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B36)]. Behçet patients with severe, specific symptoms such as vascular involvement can also go without diagnosis with these criteria, and thus the concern of delay in treatment has arisen \[[37](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B37), [38](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B38)].

In 1993, Iran presented the ISG criteria in an international conference by modifying them to overcome the problem of low sensitivity and low accuracy. According to these criteria, it consisted of five items similar to ISG, but oral aphthosis was not mandatory. Oral aphthosis was given 2 points, and other lesions were given 1 point, and 3 points were sufficient to diagnose BD \[[26](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B26)].

In 1993, Iran released a new classification system, using the Classification and Regression Tree method, called the classification tree. The presence of one of the five subgroups in the patient alone is sufficient to diagnose BD. These subgroups are as follows: oral aphthosis + genital aphthosis, oral aphthosis + skin lesions + positive pathergy test, oral aphthosis + ocular findings, genital aphthosis + ocular findings, and positive pathergy test + ocular findings \[[27](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B27)].

In 2000, the original criteria were revised by Dilsen, suggesting that three of the six diagnostic criteria were sufficient to diagnose BD. These criteria are oral aphthosis, genital ulceration, skin lesions (pseudofolliculitis, erythema nodosum), ocular findings, thrombophlebitis, and positive pathergy test \[[28](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B28)].

In 2003, Korea established its own diagnostic criterion for BD. This criterion contains six items: oral aphthosis, genital ulceration, skin lesions, ocular findings, positive pathergy test, and gastrointestinal involvement. Three points and above is sufficient to diagnose BD with three points for genital ulceration and one point for other findings \[[29](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B29)].

In 2003 the First International Workshop of Behçet’s Disease was held in Austria. In this workshop, it was decided that a team of eight countries would prepare a proposal to develop the ISG criteria and to establish new criteria for Behçet’s disease if necessary \[[35](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B35)].

In the 11th International Conference on Behçet’s Disease in Antalya (Turkey) in 2004, the International Team for the Revision of the ISG criteria was created which was composed of clinicians from 27 countries. Among these countries, in the first place comes Turkey, and the rest were Austria, Azerbaijan, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, and the USA.

Between January 2005 and June 2006, 2556 BD and 1163 control patients were included in a study who were selected by expert opinion, rather than a classification system. The International Criteria for Behçet’s Disease included a new scoring system for the diagnosis of Behçet’s disease. It consisted of six items: genital ulceration and ocular findings with 2 points and oral aphthosis, skin lesions, vascular lesions, and pathergy test with 1 point. A score of 3 or more was sufficient for the diagnosis of BD. In 2010, ICBD criteria were revised and presented at the 14th International Conference on Behçet’s Disease in London. In 2014, these criteria were published in the _Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology_. The differences from the classical form were the addition of neurological findings as 1 point and the increase of oral aphthosis to 2 points. Pathergy test was optional but 1 point should be added at its presence. Four points and above was sufficient for the diagnosis of Behçet’s disease. The sensitivity and specificity of ICBD was 94.8 and 90.5%, respectively \[[30](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B30), [31](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B31), [32](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#B32)] ([Table 2](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69944#tab2)).
